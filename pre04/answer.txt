1. Logical operators can simplify nested conditional statements. For example, can you rewrite this code using a single if statement?




2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the second time zoop is invoked.
What is the complete output?



3. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program in Section 5.8 after main invokes nLines with the parameter n == 4, just before the last invocation of nLines returns.






5. The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple methods. Consider the first verse of the song “99 Bottles of Beer”:

99 bottles of beer on the wall,
99 bottles of beer,
ya’ take one down, ya’ pass it around,
98 bottles of beer on the wall.
Subsequent verses are identical except that the number of bottles gets smaller by one in each verse, until the last verse:

No bottles of beer on the wall,
no bottles of beer,
ya’ can’t take one down, ya’ can’t pass it around,
’cause there are no more bottles of beer on the wall!
And then the song (finally) ends.

Write a program that displays the entire lyrics of “99 Bottles of Beer”. Your program should include a recursive method that does the hard part, but you might want to write additional methods to separate other parts of the program. As you develop your code, test it with a small number of verses, like 3.
